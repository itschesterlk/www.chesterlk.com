        <h2>As you may have already figured, I really dont know html.</h2>
        <p>I'm just playign around with html and css. Eventually I will actually update the main site to be epik.</p>
        <p>What sorts of info will this site contain? You might have asked.</p>
        <p>Well you ask and you recive. This site will be my portfolio. Ikik ironic how I am making a portfolio
            from scratch when I bearly know a lick of html. But trust me, I work hard to my goals and therefore I 
            belive I will have a portfolio site within no time... Maybe. Well I am actually enjoying using css so 
            we will see how this goes. Honestly, I've wanted to make a website from scratch since I started to code
            but I never did because, html is just too hard. Well thats what I thought, apparently html's terrible 
            syntax is actually not that duificult to learn. And here we are today.
